### 问题描述

---
> Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.

> A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters

> without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie,"ACE"is a subsequence of"ABCDE"while"AEC"is not).

> Here is an example:

> S ="rabbbit", T ="rabbit"

> Return3.
